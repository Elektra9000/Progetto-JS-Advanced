## JavaScript Advanced Project

This simple application allows users to search for books by their preferred category. Additionally, it enables more specific searches by author and book title. 
Try typing a literary genre, an author, or a book title.

This is the result of my third project with Start2Impact, which involved creating an application for book searches using a simple textbox. Users can enter any literary genre, author, or book title. The results can be navigated easily using the arrows. Additionally, each result will display book details (if available), the cover, and the authors. 

The project was developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Axios, and Webpack: 

- HTML defines the page structure
- CSS applies styles and ensures responsiveness across different device sizes using media queries.
- JavaScript enables all interactions on the page and facilitates API calls.
- Axios simplifies API requests.
- Webpack organizes the code and optimizes page efficiency
